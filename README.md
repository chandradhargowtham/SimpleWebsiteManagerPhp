# SimpleWebsiteManagerPhp
A simple cms system written in php which is modular. Any articles/posts you want to add can be added without editing/re adding other web content like navbars,footers etc. 

Current functionalities:
1. Just add the plain html files (without any styling) and just create a copy of the index.php file with the html file name included in it and the page works with header and footer.
2. Header and Footer has inline css which can be modified separately while the base article css is in style.css file. Modifying the style.css file properties will effect all the article pages.
3. Responsive design - may not be pretty but will work on most sizes and devices.

Upcoming features:
1. Multiple JS slides and scrolls for use- just include the file name in index.php and replace the images.
2. Contact us mailto page.
3. Dynamic retrieval of recent articles and most viewed articles and display on home page(will be a separate module which can be put in any page).
4. Search functionality.
5. Database connectivity (MySQL)
